/** Function: Functions encapsulate a block of repeatable code. Can be considered logic data.
 * declaration/definistion: using keyword 'function' to declare a function
 *  Ex. function thisIsMyFunction 
 * incocation.calling. executing/ applying: using the funciton
 * Ex. console.log(thisIsMyFunciton)
 * 
 * 
function thisIsMyFunction (parameters,parameter){
    
}

thisIsMyFunction (arguments, arguments)
var funciton = function ()


Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. If an object returned from the Function and is held in memory somewhere (referenced), that closure stays ALIVE, and data can continue to exist in these closures!
