/**
 * DATATYPES:
 * 
 * Data types are how data is catagorized in javascript. There are both complex and simple datatypes. Simple data types are limited
 * in their size and are immutible(meaning they cannot be changed). Complex data types are infinite in size, can hold both simple and complex data types within them and 
 * are mutable (meaning they can be changed.)
 * How data is catagorized in javascript
 * 
 * 
 *Primitive Datatypes
 * 
 * Number: numeric data 
 *  Ex. 5
 * 
 * String: character data
 *  Ex. 'String5432!'
 * 
 * Boolean:
 * a boollean value is a true or false value. 
 * true or false
 * 
 * NaN: not a number
 * 
 * undefined: no value,  the value that is being evaluated is not assigned as anything
 * 
 * null: no value, nullified by programer
 * 
 * Complex Datatypes: hold other values and can be infinate in size, are mutable, can be more than 8 bytes in size. 
 * 
 * Object: Can contain strings, numbers, functions, arrays or other objects. Contained in key:value pairs, wraped in curly brackets {}
 * Key is always a string. 
 */  Ex.
 *
 var dotObj = *
     {
         Name: Dot,
         Number of Pets: 5,
         Names of Pets: [Maggie, Orbit, Yogi, Tribble, Padfoot]
     }
 * 
//  * Array: 
//  *  Ex. 
 [ 'String' , 5, ['string', 5, 6,]
 * 
 * 
//  * Function: Functions encapsulate a block of repeatable code. Can be considered logic data.
//  * declaration/definition: using keyword 'function' to declare a function

 *  Ex. 
 function thisIsMyFunction (){
     
 }
